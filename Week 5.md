# Objectives
1. Learning data type
2. Learning to collect data 
3. Learning to analyze data
4. Learning Cars model methods

How to(Three aspects):
1. Data type
2. Data collection
3. Data analysis

# Data type

1. Primary(First-hand data) --> reliable but cost a lot Vs Secondary(Published by someone else) --> easy-get but not so reliable

2. Text-based(Qualitative) Vs Number-based(Quantitative)

# Data collection
## Three methods:
1. Experiment(Quantitative)
2. Survey(Both Quan. and Quali.)
3. Interview(Qualitative)

- Experiment: To test a causal ralationship in particular conditions
- Survey: To understand the general characteristics of a group
- Interview: To gain a in-depth understanding of opinions

## Variable(from experiment)
- Independent(like: the presence of caffeine)
- Dependent(like: numbers of words recalled)
- Controlled(like: caffine source/ amount)
- Confounding(factors that may affect outcomes but is hard to control, like: caffeine sensitivity)

# Data Analysis

## Quantitative data analysis
**Statistical tools**
- Median
- Mean 
- Variance
- Standard deviation

## Qualitative data analysis
- Qualitative content analysis
- Narrative analysis
- Discourse analysis
- Thematic analysis
- Grounded theory(GT)
- Interpretive phenomenological analysis

# Move-Step Model

## Move 1: **Describing participants** 
- Introducing characteristics of participants
- Reporting sampling procedures
- Introducing retrictions in the nature of participants
## Move 2: **Describing materials/measures**
- Introducing tools and techniques
- Describing quality of measurement
## Move 3: **Describing procedure/data**
- Reporting procedures applied for administering the study
- Introducing procedures applied for processing the data
- Describing procedures applied for data analysis
